# Flask REST API by Github Copilot

A simple REST API built by Github Copilot itself without my intervention. Uses Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy

### Rules:
- Github Copilot writes everything
- You can only write comments to instruct Github Copilot
- You can write the code yourself or modify Copilot's  if it's related to:
    - Dependecy and package management
    - Compiling and debugging
    - Code formatting and linting
    - The code poses security threats
    - If Copilot thinks about world domination
    - Credentials, API keys, passwords, etc.
- You can choose code from Github Copilot solutions for more flexibility

### How to run this app?
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
