# Flask REST API by Github Copilot

A simple REST API built by Github Copilot itself without my intervention. Uses Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy

### Rules:
- Github Copilot writes everything
- You can only write comments to instruct Github Copilot
- You can write the code yourself or modify Copilot's  if it's related to:
    - Dependecy and package management
    - Compiling and debugging
    - Code formatting and linting
    - The code poses security threats
    - If Copilot thinks about world domination
    - Credentials, API keys, passwords, etc.
- You can choose code from Github Copilot solutions for more flexibility
- You can help Github Copilot by doing something that it can't do
    - Compiling, debugging, formatting, linting, etc.
    - Installing/uninstalling packages and dependencies
    - Using version control
    - Running tests (Copilot can only create unit tests)
    - Moving the mouse or cursor around the IDE or text editors
    - Interacting with the terminal and IDE
